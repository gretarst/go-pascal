# Pastel

> A hobby project: a tiny Pascal interpreter written in Go. ðŸŒ¸

Pastel is inspired by *Standard Pascal: User Reference Manual* by Doug Cooper (1983),  
and is being built slowly, one concept at a time, for learning, practice, and fun.

This is **not** a serious production tool â€” it's a joyful exploration project!
